                <h1 className={"text-white"}>Welcome to My First Investment App!</h1>
                <p>This application is designed to help parents save money and teach children about the benefits of saving. Here, you can simulate the process of earning interest on savings, without
                    any real money being involved.</p>
                <p>Parents, instead of paying a weekly allowance, you can &ldquo;pay&rdquo; less than $1 a week in interest. This way, you can save more money and your children can learn about the impact of their
                    spending habits.</p>
                <p>Children, you can see how your balance grows over time as you earn interest. You can also use the &ldquo;Pretend Zone&rdquo; to simulate adding more money to your account or spending less, and
                    see how it affects your balance and interest.</p>
                <p>Remember, there&apos;s no actual money being stored or created here. It&apos;s all about learning and having fun!</p>
